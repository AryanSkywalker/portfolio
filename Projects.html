          <h1>Project Dia</h1>
          <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To develop a pipeline to read and detect answers from an image</p>
          <p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> Python, OpenCV2, Google Colaboratory, Pandas</p>
          <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 96.33%</p>
          <p>I had the idea of this project in my mind but couldn't really fathom how it can be implemented into code
             much as less work for any realtime usecase. The variety in answer sheets was just too much and so I designed my
             very own answer sheet sample that was curated to work for my pipeline and after weeks of brainstorming, the project
             came along fine!</p>
          <p>It employs rudimentary image manipulation to get a binary scan of the sheet after which we define regions and extract
             our answers. The entire process is on display in my github repository if you wanna check it out.</p>

            <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To develop an engine for transliteration from English to Hindi</p>

            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 87.66%</p>
            <p><strong>Dataset Source:</strong> Wikidata.org</p>
            <p>This was my first project for encoder decoder neural networks and was a lot of tedious work, though it paid off quite well.
               Actually it was developed as a follow-along to a similar project that was demonstrated in my Deep Learning course. It took
               a lot of brain hacking and taught me a lot. It works quite well though not at par with contemporary models as I don't
               have access to that computational power [Or The Skill].</p>

          <h1>Project Black Eye</h1>

            <p><strong>Aim:</strong> Develop a neural netwrk to recognize custom gestures</p>
            <p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> Python, OpenCV2, Google Colaboratory, Pandas, PyTorch, Convolution Neural Networks</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Dependent On Data [Remains High ~ 96%]</p>
            <p><strong>Dataset Source:</strong> Self-engineered [Can also learn on custom dataset]</p>
            <p>I developed this project first starting out with neural networks to get a feel for hyperparameter tuning and
               how neural network architecture impacts training time. Though it was mere time-pass at first, I realized it could
               be potentially be employed to engineer a visual messaging system [Maybe by contaminated patients or old-people] to
               gesture simple commands and requests by hand signs like a fist or a two finger gesture. Though I haven't acted upon
               this idea as the system needs much for sophistication and expertise beyond my own to achieve this.</p>
            <p>I use the gesture messaging system to play different playlists!</p>

          <h1>Project Enervate</h1>

            <p><strong>Aim:</strong> Develop a neural network to do arithmetic operations</p>
            <p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> Python, OpenCV2, Google Colaboratory, Pandas, PyTorch, Convolution Neural Networks</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> ~ 96% - 100%</p>
            <p><strong>Dataset Source:</strong> Augmented Data From The Infamous MNIST Dataset</p>
            <p>This was a post hello world project modification I made so as to enhance my skills and just pass time. Training on the MNIST
               dataset was quite easy however due to the challenge of overfitting the problem got compounded to data augmentation to increase
               the variety by over 5 folds. After long hours of training the model was able to recognize handwritten digits and operators.
               Then it was simple a matter of image processing to extract the region of interest, recognize the expression and do arithmetic.</p>
            <p>Maybe this project can be expanded to perform algebraic computation... [Just A Thought]</p>
